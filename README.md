# Speech-Recognition
There is 2 different programs here:
1. speech to text
2. text to speech 
These 2 programs uses speech_recognition to recognize the text/speech.
It uses Google Speech Recognition API to recognize the text/speech.
Tkinter is used as the GUI for the 2 programs

# Speech to Text Program
This program can transcribe audio file/ audio from microphone to text, which is display on a text field.
File needed: speech to text.py , audio1.wav

# Text to Speech Program
This program can play audio from .txt file and text from a text field.
The language of the text needs to be chosen from a dropdown menu. (en, zh)
The pygame is used to play the audio file created from the program.
File needed: text to speech.py , draft.txt, 
File created: text.mp3 , voice.mp3

# Things to improve
1. I am unable to play the audio file, which is created from the text to speech program, in the speech to text program. I am not sure how to change that.
